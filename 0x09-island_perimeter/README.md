# Island Perimeter Calculator

## Overview

The Island Perimeter Calculator is a Python utility that helps users determine the perimeter of an island in a given grid. It's designed for scenarios where the grid represents a landmass surrounded by water, with the goal of computing the total perimeter of the land. This utility can be useful in various applications, such as geographical analysis, gaming environments, and more.

## Installation

To use the Island Perimeter Calculator, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/island-perimeter-calculator.git
```

Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd island-perimeter-calculator
```

## Usage

The Island Perimeter Calculator is easy to use. Simply import the island_perimeter function from the module and pass your grid as an argument. Here's an example:

```python
from island_perimeter_calculator import island_perimeter

grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
]

perimeter = island_perimeter(grid)
print(f"The perimeter of the island is: {perimeter}")
```

## Features

Grid Analysis: The calculator iterates through each cell in the grid, identifying land cells and computing their contribution to the total perimeter.

Neighbor Checking: The function checks neighboring cells to account for shared sides, ensuring an accurate representation of the island's perimeter.
