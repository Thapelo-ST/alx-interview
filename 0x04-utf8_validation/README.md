# UTF-8 Checker

This Python project, utf8_checker.py, verifies if a given list of integers represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. It checks each byte's structure, following UTF-8 rules, and returns True if the data is valid and False otherwise. The project provides a simple and efficient method, validUTF8(data), for ensuring the integrity of UTF-8 encoded data. Users can incorporate this module into their applications to handle UTF-8 encoding validation with ease. Simply pass a list of integers representing bytes, and the function will validate the UTF-8 encoding, enhancing data integrity in Python projects.
This is a simple program that checks if the file you provide it with contains valid UTF-8 characters
